1. For each of parts (a) through (d), indicate whether we would generally
expect the performance of a flexible statistical learning method to be
better or worse than an inflexible method. Justify your answer.


(a) The sample size n is extremely large, and the number of predictors p is small. 
	- *answer*: flexible, we want to let the model learn 


(b) The number of predictors p is extremely large, and the number
of observations n is small. 
	- *answer*: inflexible, we may want to restrict to a linear model due to risk of overfitting to small sample space 


(c) The relationship between the predictors and response is highly
non-linear.
	- *answer*: flexible, restricting to an inflexible hypothesis class with reduce our model search space, and given the fact that the relationship is already known to be non-linear, we should allow to more freedom in the model 


(d) The variance of the error terms, i.e. Ïƒ2 = Var(), is extremely
high. 
	- *answer*: inflexible, not totally sure (consistency?)
