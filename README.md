## pyISLR 

This repo contains my notes and random implementations as I go through Introduction to Statistical Learning by James, Witten, Hastie, Tibshirani (2013) 

However, I use python instead of R, thus making this github-worthy 


However however, [someone already did this](https://github.com/JWarmenhoven/ISLR-python) and a lot better too - check them out
